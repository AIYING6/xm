# 3DOF RI-GMAPPO Policy Evaluation

Generated: 2026-07-16T14:44:39

Purpose:

```text
Evaluate a saved 3DOF EA-RG-MAPPO-S checkpoint with task-chain metrics.
This is a diagnostic artifact until multi-seed 3DOF training is completed.
```

## Configuration

```text
checkpoint = results/intercept_3d_no_role_pair_gate_baseline_smoke/runs/bc_only_seed0/actor_critic_best.pt
episodes = 2
target_policy = straight
communication_range_scale = 1.0
communication_dropout_prob = 0.0
message_delay_steps = 0
radar_dropout_prob = 0.0
failed_blue_agent = -1
node_failure_start_step = 0
node_failure_duration_steps = 0
graph_relation_ablation = none
graph_message_ablation = no_role_pair_gate
deterministic = True
```

| `chain_closed_during_failure_rate` | -1 |
| `tracking_during_failure_rate` | -1 |
| `connectivity_during_failure` | -1 |
| `avg_mean_range` | 39100.7 |

## Boundary

```text
Do not use this smoke-scale 3DOF policy evaluation as a paper result.
Use it to verify that checkpoint loading, 3DOF rollouts, and task-chain metric logging remain intact.
```
